# 🚀 UpSkillr – Workforce & Employability Intelligence Platform

UpSkillr is a **career intelligence and employability analysis platform** designed to help students and professionals understand their skill gaps, role readiness, and company-specific preparation needs using **structured, deterministic logic**.

Unlike generic AI chat tools, UpSkillr focuses on **measurable outcomes, explainable decisions, and guided upskilling paths**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The job market evolves rapidly, but:
- Students graduate without clarity on industry-required skills
- Professionals upskill without structured direction
- Skill mismatches reduce employability and career growth

There is no single platform that clearly answers:
> *“Where do I stand today, and what exactly should I do next?”*

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

UpSkillr bridges the gap between **education and employability** by:
- Comparing user skills with real job role requirements
- Identifying missing and critical skills
- Estimating employability risk
- Providing structured, role- and company-focused preparation guidance

The platform uses **deterministic rule-based logic** for analysis and **AI only for explanation and roadmap generation**.
